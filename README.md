# 🌍 Population Data Visualization using World Bank Dataset

This project analyzes and visualizes global population data from the [World Bank](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.TOTL). It includes visualizations of **gender distribution** and **age group distribution** using Python.

---

## 📌 Objective

To explore the distribution of population across different countries by:
- Gender (Male vs. Female)
- Age groups (0–14, 15–64, 65+)

This project was completed as part of an **academic internship** focused on data science and data visualization skills.

---

## 📊 Visualizations Included

- **Bar Chart**: Gender distribution by country

- **Histogram & Stacked Bar Chart**: Age group distribution by country (0–14, 15–64, 65+)
